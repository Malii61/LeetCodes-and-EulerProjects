https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/

Problem:

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i^th customer has in the j^th bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Solution:

public class Solution {
    public int MaximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int wealth=0;
        int maxWealth = 0;
        int maxWealthCustomer = 0;
        bool equalOrNot = false;
        for(int i = 0 ; i<accounts.GetLength(0) ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j< accounts[i].GetLength(0); j++){
                wealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            Console.WriteLine(i+1 + ". customer has wealth = " + wealth);
            if(wealth>maxWealth){
                maxWealth = wealth;
                maxWealthCustomer = i+1;
            }
            else if(wealth == maxWealth){
                equalOrNot = true;
            }
            wealth = 0;
        }
        if(!equalOrNot){
            Console.WriteLine("The "+ maxWealthCustomer + ". customer is the richest with a wealth of " + maxWealth);
        }
        else{
            Console.WriteLine("Both customers are considers the richest a wealth of "+ maxWealth + " each, so return " + maxWealth);
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
}
